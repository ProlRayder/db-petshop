# Virtual Petshop - Management System with MySQL

Welcome to the Virtual Petshop project repository, a system designed to manage all daily operations of a petshop business. This project was developed as part of the learning in Database Fundamentals.

## Project description

We were recently faced with the challenge of creating a comprehensive system that could manage customers, animals, sales and inventory for a virtual pet store. We chose to use the MySQL database due to its scalability, ease of use and broad compatibility with other tools and programming languages.

## MySQL Database

### Database Structure

- Tables for customers, animals, products and sales.
- Relationships between tables to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Features Developed

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented for all entities.
- Use of the SQL language to interact with the database.

## Project development

With the database structure established, we focused our efforts on developing the system's functionalities. The SQL language was fundamental to connect the system to MySQL and create the necessary operations to manage the stored information.

## MySQL Highlights

MySQL proved to be a powerful and reliable tool throughout the project. Its scalability, storage efficiency and data security characteristics were fundamental to the success of our virtual petshop system.

## Recommendation

Based on our experience, we recommend using MySQL as a database for similar projects. Its flexibility and performance made it an excellent choice for efficiently managing large volumes of data in our system.
